# Spacebuild-Redux-Project
A project to update and refresh Spacebuild with Garry's Mod 13

Installation
------------
Not currently playable unless you have the materials, models and sounds. If you insist on installing this,
or would like to help in the development process, put both folders into the addon folder.
I'll add a link to download the models, materials, and sounds later.
